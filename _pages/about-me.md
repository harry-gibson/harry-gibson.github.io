### ABOUT 

I'm a geospatial software developer and data analyst. I love getting to grips with data and problems - especially spatial ones, coming up with solutions, and helping people to understand what they're trying to do and how to do it.

#### EXPERIENCE

I have a BSc majoring in computer science; a PhD in environmental science with GIS, and over twelve years experience working as a consultant, a researcher, and a problem solver. 

I've worked in areas as diverse as management of landscapes for carbon sequestration, to modelling global health outcomes.

I have experience with ArcGIS, QGIS, FME, Python, Numpy, Pandas, Cython, SQL, Postgres, GeoServer, GDAL/OGR, raster processing, remote sensing data, C# .NET, Google Earth Engine, Google Cloud Platform, drones and UAVs, and more. 

#### CURRENTLY

I'm working at the <a href="https://map.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Malaria Atlas Project</a>, a research group in the <a href="https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Big Data Institute</a> at the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Oxford</a>. We assemble global databases on malaria risk and intervention coverage and, among other things develop innovative methods that use remotely sensed data to better understand the global landscape of malaria risk at fine geographical scales.

I'm the halfway point in our group between the academic researchers and statisticians, and the full-time developers. I figure out what data support the academics need to get their work done, and how to produce it for them.

I'm based in North Oxfordshire, and am always keen to hear of new opportunities. Please <a href="mailto:harry.s.gibson@gmail.com">get in touch</a>! You can download a PDF of my CV [here](../other/cv_Harry_Gibson_online.pdf).
