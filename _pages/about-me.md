### ABOUT 

I'm a geospatial software developer and data analyst. I love getting to grips with data and problems - especially spatial ones, coming up with solutions, and helping people to understand what they're trying to do and how to do it.

#### EXPERIENCE

I have a BSc majoring in computer science; a PhD in environmental science with GIS, and over twelve years experience working as a consultant, a researcher, and a problem solver. 

I've worked in areas as diverse as management of landscapes for carbon sequestration, to modelling global health outcomes.

I have experience with ArcGIS, QGIS, FME, Python, Numpy, Pandas, Cython, SQL, Postgres, GeoServer, GDAL/OGR, raster processing, remote sensing data, C# .NET, Google Earth Engine, Google Cloud Platform, drones and UAVs, and more. 

#### CURRENT AND RECENT WORK

I'm currently working on the <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Oxford Martin School</a> research programme on <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/informal-cities/" target="_blank">Informal Cities</a>. We are seeking to use deep learning methods to map informal settlements from high-resolution satellite imagery, and to combine these outputs with other spatial covariates and public health data to understand health outcomes in such areas. As a Geospatial Data Scientist, I lead on the geospatial aspects of this work, as well as contributing to the processing and investigation of health data.

Prior to this I spent six years in the <a href="https://malariaatlas.org/" target="_blank">Malaria Atlas Project</a>, a research group that was then based in the <a href="https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Big Data Institute</a> at the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Oxford</a>. We assembled global databases on malaria risk and intervention coverage and, among other things developed innovative methods that use remotely sensed data to better understand the global landscape of malaria risk at fine geographical scales.

In this role I was the halfway point in our group between the academic researchers and statisticians, and the full-time developers. This was a unique position that played to my multidisciplinary strengths, figuring out what data support the academics need to get their work done, and how to produce it for them.

I'm based in North Oxfordshire, and am always keen to hear of new opportunities. Please <a href="mailto:harry.s.gibson@gmail.com">get in touch</a>!
