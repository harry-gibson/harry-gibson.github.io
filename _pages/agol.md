## Making Research Accessible

#### *Publicising research outputs through interactive web mapping applications*

In 2015, colleagues in the Malaria Atlas Project <a href="http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature15535" target="_blank">published in Nature</a> a landmark paper quantifying the changes in malaria burden in Africa since 2000, and showing how the reduction in cases since then can be attributed to "intervention" efforts, such as the widespread distribution of mosquito bednets. 

This paper caused great interest, particularly due to the headline grabbing figure that 663 million cases of malaria had been averted by these interventions since 2000.

In an effort to make the research accessible as widely as possible, I created <a href="https://oxforduni.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=77e0052c6e6146caaf1114c6268d274a" target="_blank">this ESRI Story Map</a>. This involved summarising and explaining the research in accessible language, configuring ArcGIS Image Services, hosting summary data on ArcGIS Online, and authoring the presentation. 

The map was well received and is featured by ESRI in their flagship "Living Atlas" gallery of top ArcGIS Online content.
